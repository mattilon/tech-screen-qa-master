# Introduction
Assume that you are tasked to test an online retail store, Assemble Store, using manual and automated tests.  Add the Assemble Store repo into your own Github account, from the `tech-screen-qa-master.zip` file.  Install and run the Assemble Store.

1. Write manual Test Cases for the store based upon the Requirements in `REQUIREMENTS.md`, and put in a folder called `tests`.
2. Execute the manual tests, and write up bug reports for all bugs found, and file as Github Issues in your repo.
3. Implement an automated test framework and add to the Github repo.
4. Create & execute the previously written manual tests as automated tests with test results, and add to the Github repo.

Please do not spend more than 3 hours on this exercise, we are looking at how you approach the task, not necessarily on the final outcome.  Feel free to add comments explaining trade-offs you had to make, as well as features or functionality that you didn't have the time to implement.

## Submitting
1. Steps 1,3 & 4 above should be submitted as pull requests in your GitHub repository for this exercise. 
2. Please invite `assemble-engineering` to the repository when you are done and send an email to `techscreen-qa@assembleinc.com` with a link to your repo.

## Bonuses
1. Fix any bug(s) found in your testing and check-in the code
2. Stub out the remote images API server, so you can return different error responses
3. Setup automated load testing, and find the point of degradation
